# Deepfake Detection

## Overview

This project implements a deep learning-based solution for detecting deepfake media content. The detection system uses a combination of computer vision techniques such as Gabor feature extraction and ORB keypoint detection, alongside a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on the Xception architecture. The model is capable of classifying images or frames from videos as either authentic or deepfake.

## Features

- **Frame Extraction**: Automatically extracts frames from video at a specific FPS rate for analysis.
- **Gabor Feature Extraction**: Uses Gabor filters to capture texture-based features.
- **ORB Keypoint Detection**: Detects keypoints and descriptors in filtered images to capture important visual features.
- **Non-Maximum Suppression**: Reduces redundant keypoints to improve detection accuracy.
- **Deep Learning Classification**: Leverages the Xception model for deepfake classification.

## Project Structure

```bash
.
├── models             # Contains pre-trained models and weights
├── data               # Folder to store videos and images
├── src                # Source code for the project
├── README.md          # Project documentation
└── requirements.txt   # Python dependencies
```

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/deepfake-detection.git
   cd deepfake-detection
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies**:
   Install the necessary Python libraries using the `requirements.txt` file.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download Pre-trained Weights**:
   Download the pre-trained Xception model weights from [here](https://keras.io/api/applications/xception/) or use the built-in Keras Xception model.

## Usage

1. **Preprocessing**:
   The system extracts frames from videos at a set frame-per-second (FPS) rate and resizes the images for further analysis.

2. **Running the Deepfake Detection Pipeline**:
   You can run the detection pipeline on a video by calling the following function:
   ```python
   from src.deepfake_detection import deepfake_detection_pipeline
   
   video_path = 'data/input_video.mp4'
   deepfake_detection_pipeline(video_path)
   ```

3. **Training**:
   If you wish to retrain or fine-tune the model, the code uses transfer learning on the Xception model. Modify `src/train.py` to adjust training parameters.

## How It Works

- **Frame Extraction**: The system extracts frames from videos at a rate of 1 FPS for performance optimization.
- **Feature Extraction**: Gabor filters are applied to the extracted frames to capture texture details. ORB is used to extract keypoints, which are refined using Non-Maximum Suppression.
- **Classification**: A pre-trained CNN model (Xception) classifies each frame as either deepfake or authentic. The majority vote over all frames determines the final classification of the video.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Scikit-Image

You can install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Example

```python
from src.deepfake_detection import deepfake_detection_pipeline

# Path to your video file
video_path = 'data/sample_video.mp4'

# Run the detection pipeline
deepfake_detection_pipeline(video_path)
```

## Dataset

This project uses the [DeepFake Detection Challenge (DFDC) dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/deepfake-detection-challenge/data) for training and evaluation. The dataset includes both authentic and manipulated media, which is essential for training robust models.

## Future Improvements

- **Support for Real-Time Detection**: Enhance the pipeline to process video streams in real-time.
- **Additional Deep Learning Architectures**: Experiment with different CNN architectures (EfficientNet, ResNet) for improved detection accuracy.
- **Data Augmentation**: Apply advanced data augmentation techniques to improve model generalization.
